# Godot Launcher Documentation

This repository contains the source code for the official **Godot Launcher Documentation**, built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static site generator.

## ðŸ“– Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! The Godot Launcher documentation is open source, just like the [Godot Luncher](https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher) Project.

Feel free to fix typos, improve, or add new content. To contribute:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request

Make sure to follow the existing structure and style for consistency.

> Keep in mind that this documentation is the public face of the Godot Launcher project documentation. For that reason, major edits or structural changes should be approached thoughtfully. While you donâ€™t need to submit a formal proposal, itâ€™s highly recommended to open an issue in this repo or start a discussion in the Godot Launcher Discord, where community conversations about the website and project happen regularly.
