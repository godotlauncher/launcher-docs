# Create Your First Project

You can create a new project and start editing in seconds, or choose to add an existing project to start using it with Godot Launcher.

## Create a new Project

1. Navigate to the **Projects** section from the left-hand navigation menu.
2. Click **Create Project** and follow the prompts to set up a new project.

## Add an Existing Project

Already have a Godot project? Click **Add**, pick the folder that contains `project.godot`, and the launcher will register it without moving any files. The project then appears in your **Projects** list, ready to launch with the best matching editor.

For version-selection rules, Mono handling, and integration details, visit [Add an Existing Project](/getting-started/add-existing-project).
