1. Navigate to the **Installs** section from the left-hand navigation menu.
2. Click on the **Install Editor** button. This will open a modal popup where you can select which version of the Godot editor to install.
3. In the modal, choose the desired editor version and click on the corresponding icon for either **GDScript** or **.NET**.
   - The icon will change to indicate the current status: **Downloading/Installing** and finally **Installed** once the process is complete.
4. After the installation is complete, close the modal by clicking the **X** button in the top-right corner.

You can also experiment with prerelease versions of the editor by selecting them from the install screen.
