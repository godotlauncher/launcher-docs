# Installing Git

To use Git with your Godot projects in Godot Launcher, you must have Git installed on your system.

## Check if Git is Installed

Open a terminal and run:

~~~bash
git --version
~~~

If Git is installed, you'll see something like:

~~~bash
git version 2.39.5 (Apple Git-154)
~~~

:::info
If you see a ‚Äúcommand not found‚Äù or similar error, Git is not installed.

## Install Git

You can download and install Git from the official website:  
üëâ [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Follow the instructions for your operating system.
