# Installing Godot Launcher with winget

Starting with **Godot Launcher v1.4.0**, we publish an official [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/) manifest that tracks every Windows release. This gives you a trusted, script-friendly way to install and keep the launcher up to date without leaving the terminal.

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763) or later, or Windows 11.  
- The **App Installer** package from the Microsoft Store, which provides the `winget` client.  
- Administrative rights the first time you install, so winget can unpack the signed installer.

You can confirm that winget is available by running `winget --info`. If it is missing, open the [App Installer listing](https://www.microsoft.com/p/app-installer/9nblggh4nns1) in the Microsoft Store and click **Get**.

## Install the latest release

<WingetCommandList
  commands={[
    {
      label: "Install (Recommended)",
      command: 'winget install "Godot Launcher"',
    },
    {
      label: "Install via Package ID",
      command: "winget install GodotLauncher.Launcher",
    },
  ]}
  intro="Run one of these commands from PowerShell or Command Prompt to install the newest Godot Launcher build:"
  hint="The manifest downloads the signed installer published on our GitHub releases and verifies its SHA-256 checksum before completing."
/>

During the first install you may be prompted to accept the installer or elevate privileges. After completion, Godot Launcher appears in your Start Menu just like the manual installer.

## Keep Godot Launcher updated

<WingetCommandList
  commands={[
    {
      label: "Upgrade in place",
      command: "winget upgrade GodotLauncher.Launcher",
    },
    {
      label: "Upgrade all packages",
      command: "winget upgrade --all --include-unknown",
    },
  ]}
  intro="Winget can upgrade Godot Launcher when a new release lands:"
  hint="Upgrades run the same signed installer with your existing settings preserved. `--include-unknown` ensures winget checks packages that do not expose version metadata."
/>

You can check whether an upgrade is available without running it by using `winget upgrade --name "Godot Launcher"`.

---

## Discover other manifest details

- `winget show GodotLauncher.Launcher` prints publisher metadata, installer URLs, and release notes.  
- `winget search "godot launcher"` confirms you are selecting the official package before installing.  
- `winget list Godot` reports whether the launcher is already installed.

Manifests are kept in sync with every Windows release. If a command fails with **No applicable update found**, you are already on the latest version.

---

## Uninstall or reinstall

- `winget uninstall GodotLauncher.Launcher` removes the launcher. Your Godot projects remain intact.  
- `winget install --id GodotLauncher.Launcher --source winget --silent` reinstalls without UI and is useful in CI scripts.  
- Pair `winget uninstall` followed by a fresh `winget install` if you need to repair a corrupted installation.

---

## Troubleshooting tips

- Run `winget source update` if winget cannot find the package, especially after waking a machine from sleep.  
- If the Microsoft Store is blocked, download the latest **App Installer** `.msixbundle` directly from the store page to enable winget.  
- For enterprise environments, export the manifest with `winget export GodotLauncher.Launcher --output winget.json` and import it on managed devices.

If you continue to run into issues, grab the log from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\DiagOutputDir\` and share it when opening an issue so we can help.
